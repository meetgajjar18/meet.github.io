    <h2>Dataset Example</h2>
    <p>For the dataset, I have selected the <a href="https://data.nasdaq.com/institutional-investors" target="_blank">Nasdaq Institutional Investors Dataset</a>. The Dataset i have selected Nasdaq institutional investors dataset gives information regarding the trading and investment activities of the United States. The Potential application of this dataset is would be Market prediction and analysis for an example by analysing the trades and positions of the investors one get the overall sentiment of the current market and get benifits.Second use case is Risk assessment, this data can be used by risk managers to evaluate the market by tracking the "Smart Money" one can predict volatility or stability in the overall market or a specific sector like IT, pharmaceuticals or commodity. Moreover the regulatory bodies can use the dataset to ensure that the investors and traders comply with the market regulations and also using the power of the data can detect "Wolf" who do unusual activates.</p>

    <h2>Data Science Book</h2>
    <p>I have chosen the book <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" target="_blank">Deep Learning</a> by by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. All the authors are experts from all the fields like artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning. In the book it offers comprehensive introduction to deep learning it covers both theoretical concepts and practical applications. If someone passionate about AI and data science this book is really good in my opinion also this book is excellent resource to increase understanding of neural networks and architectures used in AI systems.</p>
